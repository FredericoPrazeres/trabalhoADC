Quais os nós mais acessados nos caminhos? Porque será que são estes?

1. Popular Paths or Routes
Identify frequently taken paths between specific articles.
Explore paths that have the most traffic or are considered efficient.

2. Shortest Paths
Analyze the shortest paths between articles.
Investigate articles that are often starting or ending points for users.

3. Centrality Measures
Calculate centrality measures (e.g., degree centrality, betweenness centrality) to identify crucial articles in the network.

4. User Behavior Analysis
Study patterns in user behavior—do users tend to navigate between specific categories or types of articles more often?
Explore how user paths might vary based on the type of content they're navigating (e.g., history, science, geography).

5. Time Analysis
Analyze timestamps (if available) to understand peak navigation times or patterns over time.
Explore how navigation behavior changes during different periods (e.g., weekdays vs. weekends, morning vs. evening).

6. Community Detection
Apply community detection algorithms to identify clusters or groups of articles that are frequently visited together.
Explore if there are thematic clusters based on user navigation.

7. Navigation Biases
Investigate biases in navigation: Are users more likely to jump to related articles or seemingly unrelated ones?
Explore if there are any biases towards articles with certain characteristics (length, topic, etc.).

8. Popular Articles or Hubs
Identify articles that act as hubs connecting various other articles.
Find articles that are frequently visited but might not necessarily be start or end points.

9. Network Visualization
Create visualizations of the navigation network to understand the structure and connections between articles.
Use visualizations to highlight important nodes or clusters.

10. Path Diversity
Measure the diversity of paths taken by users.
Analyze how users explore different paths to reach the same destination.
